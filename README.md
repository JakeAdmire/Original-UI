## Why?
Why did I build **Original-UI?** Several reasons really: 
- I thought it'd be fun (and it is!)
- I wanted to stay sharp with React & JavaScript while searching for a Front End Engineering role ([hire me!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakeadmire/))
- I thoroughly enjoy UI & UX design and this seemed like a great opportunity to practice it
